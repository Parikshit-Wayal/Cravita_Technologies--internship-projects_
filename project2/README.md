### 3. Tools and AWS Console Sections Used

- **EC2 Console:** For instance creation, SSH, and web server validation.
- **RDS Console:** For creating the DB instance and managing test data.
- **AWS Backup Console:**
  - **Backup Vaults** ‚Äì for vault selection and recovery points
  - **Backup Plans** ‚Äì to create the plan and assign resources
  - **Protected Resources** ‚Äì to confirm resource association and view backups
  - **Backup Jobs** ‚Äì to monitor backup progress and status

### 4. Issues Faced and How They Were Resolved

- **Issue:** Confusion over image preview/linking when writing up screenshots in markdown  
  **Solution:** Used `./screenshots/imagename.png` relative links for flawless GitHub display.

- **Issue:** Waiting for backup jobs to complete for sizable RDS snapshots  
  **Solution:** Monitored the Backup Jobs page and proceeded only after receiving "Completed" status.

- **Issue:** Navigating AWS Backup plan creation steps (e.g., direct vs tag-based resource assignment)  
  **Solution:** Used direct resource assignment by ID for clarity and certainty in this project context.

**Result:**  
Both the EC2 and RDS resources are protected by an automated, centralized AWS Backup plan, with verified on-demand and scheduled recoverability, achieving robust disaster recovery best practices!
